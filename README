polar_matching is an implementation of the Polar Scan Matching (PSM)
approach for matching 2D laser scans and can be downloaded at 
www.irrc.monash.edu.au/adiosi. More about PSM can be found in:

A. Diosi and L. Kleeman, "Fast Laser Scan Matching using Polar Coordinates",
Published in 2007 in IJRR

A. Diosi and L. Kleeman, "Laser Scan Matching in Polar Coordinates
with Application to SLAM " Proceedings of 2005 IEEE/RSJ International
Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, August, 2005, Edmonton,
Canada

Code for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is not
distributed in this package. This package contains only the laser scan
matching approach PSM (and ICP for comparison) and example code. 
PSM has been tested with Sick LMS 200, Hokuyo URG-04LX and Hokuyo
UTM-30LX scans. There are big performance reserves in the 
implementation as the code has not been optimized yet. polar_matching 
is still a work in progress.

polar_matching has been tested on Fedora Core 11. The drawing 
part of polar_matching requires X11, therefore it will not 
work under non-Unix OS. However the core of scan matching 
possibly compiles under other operating systems with very 
little work. 

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

In a Linux console unzip polar_matching_vX.zip by typing 
"unzip polar_matching_vX.zip". Go into the directory polar_matching 
by typing "cd polar_matching". Compile the library and test program 
by typing "make all". Then run the example program "./example".



I hope that despite the weak documentation and hard to read coding,
polar_matching will be useful to someone. If you have got any
questions or comments please write me an email with PSM on the
subject line. I'll may be able to help. When you find pairs of
scans where PSM fails while it should not, please send them my
way as it may help me to improve PSM.

Change Log
  2006-2010 - Works with a number of laser scanners. Removed unused code. 
              Removed psm_c to lessen the work needed for maintenance.
              Moved psm into a library. Changed ICP's scan projection to that of PSM 
              to reduce programming time needed to make it work with generic scans. 
              Changed the license to BSD. Added an example. Improved documentation.
              There also is a minor interface change: the scan preprocessing 
              functions are no longer accessible separately. 
              Use pm_preprocessScan instead.
